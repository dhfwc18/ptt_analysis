This project aims to analyse political sentiment embedded in the content of Taiwan's PTT forum. The analysis is intended to be a follow up reflection/improvement of a dissertation study back in 2020, containing a crawler, a CNN based neural network built using TensorFlow and a short ipython/Jupyter notebook report. The crawler is not meant for commercial use and any usage outside of educational analysis is not supported nor endorse by the author.
